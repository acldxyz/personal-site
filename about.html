    <h2>About</h2>

    <p><em>A pursuit of the absurd and truthful.</em></p>

    <p>I started in tech banking at <strong>Piper Jaffray</strong>, moved to the buy-side at <strong>StepStone</strong>, and then joined <strong>Mousse Partners</strong>, a large family office, where I invested in venture funds and companies. I joined <strong>Privateer</strong>, one of the companies I invested in at Mousse, to lead strategic finance. There, I redesigned the shopping funnel for a three-sided marketplace and worked on a spectrum of public, private, and fundraising transactions. I brought <strong>Delta Emerald</strong>, a data science-powered VC firm, onto the cap table through one of those fundraises, built a relationship with the firm over three years, and then joined to lead capital formation.</p>

    <p>I became a father in November 2024 and took an extended break to spend time with my son. No other adventure has been as beautiful or absurd. Writing about it at <a href="https://heirloom.substack.com">heirloom.substack.com</a>.</p>

        <strong>StepStone Group</strong> | Analyst | NYC | 2012 – 2015. I met with hundreds of managers and entrepreneurs. Exceptional talent came through the door, but we couldn't match them with an LP because they weren't at a fund IV yet. I wanted to partner with emerging managers at fund I.

        <strong>Mousse Partners</strong> | Associate | NYC | 2015 – 2018. One of a two-person team managing a $1 billion venture portfolio of fund and direct investments.

      <p>
        Privateer was another Mousse portfolio company, and one where I sat on the board. The company operated across North America's legal cannabis markets. As $60 billion of annual spend in illicit markets moved into legal channels, it presented stark opportunities for technology: education, commerce, resource management, compliance, and logistics. I wanted to build in that vacuum. I led M&A and capital markets for the portfolio. We completed two mergers and raised more than $400 million.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <p>
        Some of that capital came from Delta Emerald, a data-science-powered investment firm. I managed the firm's data products, translating $3 billion of annual transaction data into insights for portfolio companies and LPs.

    <div class="about-section">
      <p>
        I became a father in November 2024, and that has been my primary focus since. No other adventure has been so beautiful and so absurd. Most of the time, there's no difference between the two.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <p>
        Delta Emerald wound down in early 2025. I'm now looking for my next role, one with a family office in need of a private markets lead, or a growth-stage business in need of a strategic finance lead.
