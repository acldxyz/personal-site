    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Tech banking at <strong>Piper Jaffray</strong> led to the buy-side at <strong>StepStone</strong>, then to <strong>Mousse Partners</strong>, a family office, where I invested in venture funds and companies. I joined <strong>Privateer</strong>, one of those investments, to lead strategic finance. I worked on a spectrum of public and private transactions and redesigned a marketplace. I brought <strong>Delta Emerald</strong>, a data science-powered VC firm, onto the cap table through a fundraise. After three years working together, I joined to lead comms and insights.</p>

    <p>I became a father in November 2024 and took an extended break to spend time with my son. No other adventure has been as beautiful or absurd. Writing about it at <a href="https://heirloom.substack.com">heirloom.substack.com</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm looking for my next role leading private markets for a family office or strategic finance for a growth-stage business.</p>

        <strong>Piper Jaffray</strong> | TMT Investment Banking Analyst | NYC | 2010 – 2012. Fortuitous timing as Internet 2.0 and social media 1.0 ramped.

        <strong>StepStone Group</strong> | Analyst | NYC | 2012 – 2015. I met with hundreds of managers and entrepreneurs. Exceptional talent came through the door, but we couldn't match them with an LP because they weren't at a fund IV yet. I wanted to partner with emerging managers at fund I.

      <p>
        <strong>Privateer Holdings</strong> | Principal | Seattle | 2019 – 2022. $60B of annual cannabis spend transitioned from the illicit market to the legal. The complex patchwork of new markets presented an ideal environment for purpose-built tech. Privateer had a portfolio of operating subsidiaries, and I spent most of my time with Leafly, a three-sided marketplace. I led the finance and data teams and redesigned the shopping funnel and sales strategy, resulting in a 380% and 52% lift in GMV and monetized accounts, respectively. Across Privateer, I negotiated two mergers and raised over $100M.
