    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>A pursuit of the absurd and truthful</h3>

    <p>Tech banking at <strong>Piper Jaffray</strong> led to the buy-side at <strong>StepStone</strong>, then to <strong>Mousse Partners</strong>, a family office, where I invested in venture funds and companies. <strong>Privateer</strong>, an investment I led at Mousse, recruited me to lead strategic finance and complete a spectrum of public and private market transactions. I brought <strong>Delta Emerald</strong>, a data science-powered VC firm, onto the cap table through a fundraise, and later joined to lead external marketing and internal research.</p>

    <p>I became a father in November 2024 and took an extended break to spend time with my son. No other adventure has been as beautiful or absurd. Writing about it at <a href="https://heirlloom.substack.com">heirlloom.substack.com</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm looking for my next role leading private markets for a family office or strategic finance for a growth-stage business.</p>

        <strong>Privateer Holdings</strong> | Principal | Seattle | 2019 – 2022. $60B of annual cannabis spend transitioned from the illicit market to the legal. The complex patchwork of new markets presented an ideal environment for purpose-built tech. Privateer had a portfolio of operating subsidiaries, across which I negotiated two mergers and raised over $100M. I spent most of my time with Leafly, Privateer's three-sided marketplace. I led the finance and data teams and redesigned the monetization strategy, resulting in a 380% lift in GMV and 52% growth in monetized accounts.

        <strong>Dad</strong> | NYC | 2025 – Present. Delta Emerald wound down shortly after my son was born. I took an extended break to care for him. It's been the greatest adventure. A few months into it, I started Heirlloom, a collection of essays and guides that have helped hundreds of new dads.

I'm now searching for my next role, either leading privates for a family office or strategic finance for a growth-stage company. I'm open to select contract/consulting engagements in the interim.

        <p>I had one mission growing up: going fast on a board. Skateboards. Surfboards. Snowboards. I loved them all. Competitive snowboarding took me all over the U.S., and for several years, I qualified for and competed in the US Open. I took up rowing at Trinity College, securing several regional and national championships.</p>
