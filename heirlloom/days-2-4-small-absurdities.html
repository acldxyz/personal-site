      <h3>Ronan vs bureaucracy</h3>

      <p>Ronan required a surgical procedure during the hospital stay. The scheduled procedure ran an hour behind, and by the time staff retrieved him, he hadn't eaten for four hours. His disposition reflected this frustration.</p>

      <p>The operation concluded successfully. Within thirty minutes of his return, we fed him, and he fell asleep. Upon waking, he needed a fresh diaper. I asked the nursing staff if I could observe the process, having changed fewer than twenty diapers previously and none involving post-surgical care.</p>

      <p>The nurse who had accompanied Ronan to surgery returned. She carried herself with the composed assurance of someone who derives satisfaction from repetitive work performed countless times.</p>

      <p>She bent over the bassinet to undress him. When I posed a question and she looked up to answer, a solid stream hit her square between the eyes. She regained composure, toweled off, and resumed the task. When she lifted his legs, an explosive sound filled the room&mdash;the result of such forceful bowel movement that it struck the back of the bassinet and everything in between. I found dark humor in the situation, recognizing it as evidence that the newborn held grudges.</p>

      <h3>Unnecessary alarm</h3>

      <p>Hospital infant abductions remain rare but do occur. I was unaware of this risk before becoming a parent.</p>

      <p>Security systems protect labor and delivery exits. An RFID sensor embedded in each baby's ankle triggers a building-wide alarm if approached. If bureaucratic madness had a sound, this would be it. Our hospital room sat immediately adjacent to an exit. The floor staff gained continuous notification of Ronan's movements in and out of the room.</p>

      <h3>Final form</h3>

      <p>During our final overnight stay, a nurse delivered discharge paperwork. After I completed the birth certificate documentation, I fell asleep.</p>

      <p>When Ronan returned from the nursery, another floor-wide alarm sounded. Cait examined the completed forms and discovered her frustration mounting. I had filled multiple blank spaces with ink scrawled across the page. Most troubling were three instances where I had misspelled her surname as "Brynes" instead of the correct spelling.</p>

      <h3>Exit strategy</h3>

      <p>Discharge was anticipated at 10 a.m. on the final day. By 7 a.m., we had packed. At 4 p.m., an orderly transported Cait to the hospital exit.</p>

      <p>Cait joined Ronan in the vehicle's rear seat. She grimaced with each subtle movement, as any motion triggered pain from the surgical recovery. I drove with exceptional care into a winter sunset, focusing intently on the road while Cait attended to the newborn.</p>

      <p>For thirty minutes, we navigated around potholes and sharp curves. Upon turning onto our street, we discovered a speed bump approximately one hundred feet from our driveway. I stopped. We exchanged glances through the mirror. She indicated we should proceed forward, accepting the discomfort that would follow.</p>
