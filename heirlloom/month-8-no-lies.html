      <p>Ronan accepted bottles at any temperature&mdash;cold, tepid, or warm didn't matter to him. He was content to eat.</p>

      <p>Eventually, I learned that cold bottles strained his digestive system. Since Ronan spit up frequently, warming bottles seemed logical to improve his comfort. It worked initially. However, instead of expanding his temperature tolerance, he developed his first rigid preference.</p>

      <p>If offered anything below 98 degrees, he'd reject it forcefully. Hunger wouldn't sway him. Once reaching the "reheat or we'll be stuck here" point, I'd carry Ronan and his refused bottle downstairs. His sharp breath communicated: <em>Remove this inferior beverage immediately.</em></p>

      <p>Every four hours, Ronan demanded his bottle reliably. As long as it was hot, he'd consume it entirely. Sleeping and eating comprised his world, both of which he pursued passionately.</p>

      <p>One afternoon changed this pattern&mdash;Ronan refused solids entirely. No food interested him. Surely he'd compensate with a bottle instead.</p>

      <p>Twenty minutes later, the bottle touched his mouth and he immediately batted it away. Balancing precariously in my lap, I searched the floor frantically. Upon retrieval, I tested it on my wrist&mdash;sufficiently warm. We repeated this cycle multiple times before returning downstairs.</p>

      <p>After fifteen minutes, we tried again upstairs. The bottle, now warmer, was offered. Again, he refused.</p>

      <p>His resistance baffled me. My exhaustion had eliminated rational thinking, leaving only instinct. "Why won't you eat? You love eating!" My voice grew sharp. "Why ignore me? I understand you better than you understand yourself."</p>

      <p>The situation escalated. Cait intervened, and Ronan fell asleep in her arms immediately.</p>

      <p>Downstairs, we speculated: Was he overtired? Teething? Unwell? Serious or minor? We had no answers.</p>

      <p>The doctor's visit came the next morning&mdash;diagnosis: hand, foot, and mouth disease. His mouth interior was covered with painful open blisters.</p>

      <p>Remorse overwhelmed me. He was suffering. Anything in his mouth caused pain, yet I'd insisted on feeding him. I refused to recognize what he was communicating about his own needs. He wasn't employing strategic game theory&mdash;he simply possessed the ability to signal discomfort through the only means available.</p>
