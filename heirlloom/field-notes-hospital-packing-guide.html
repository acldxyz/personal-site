    <div class="article-body">
      <p>Whether you're preparing for a scheduled delivery or packing a go-bag for the unexpected, a few nights in the hospital will test your comfort. Here's what to bring, what to skip, and what to take home.</p>

      <h3>Essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality instant coffee.</strong> Hospital coffee is unreliable. Bring your own and a travel mug.</li>
        <li><strong>Toiletries.</strong> Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, face wash, lip balm, moisturizer.</li>
        <li><strong>Water bottle.</strong> A large one. Hydration is critical, especially for the recovering parent.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye mask and earplugs.</strong> Nurses check in around the clock. Light and sound are constant.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfortable clothing.</strong> Sweats, t-shirts, socks, a sweatshirt, and extra underwear for both parents.</li>
        <li><strong>Slippers and sandals.</strong> Slippers for the room, sandals for the shower.</li>
        <li><strong>Long phone and computer chargers.</strong> Outlets are never where you need them.</li>
        <li><strong>iPad or laptop.</strong> For entertainment during the long stretches between feedings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-essentials (but worth it)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your own pillow.</strong> Bring a colored pillowcase so it doesn't get mixed in with hospital linens.</li>
        <li><strong>Shower towel.</strong> Hospital towels are small and rough.</li>
        <li><strong>Weighted blanket.</strong> If it helps you sleep at home, it'll help you sleep here.</li>
        <li><strong>Snacks.</strong> Have visitors bring these. You'll want variety and won't have time to shop.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Take from the hospital</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diapers and wipes.</strong> They'll give you as many as you want. Stock up.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloth swaddles.</strong> The hospital ones are perfect for the first few weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Premixed formula bottles.</strong> Even if you plan to breastfeed, have backup. The small, ready-to-feed bottles are incredibly convenient at 3 a.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Knit caps.</strong> Newborns lose heat quickly. The hospital caps work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic syringes.</strong> Useful for administering medicine and supplements in the weeks ahead.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Leave behind</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hospital bottle nipples.</strong> They work in a pinch but aren't designed for regular use.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic buckets.</strong> They'll offer one for sponge baths. You won't need it at home.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A few more notes</h3>
      <p>Sleep will be interrupted regardless of preparation. Accept this early. If the hospital offers a nursery, use it without guilt&mdash;the nurses are there to help, and rest matters.</p>

      <p>Discharge takes longer than anyone tells you. Plan for delays. Pack the car seat early and practice the installation before the big day. We put it in the middle of the back seat for the safest position.</p>
