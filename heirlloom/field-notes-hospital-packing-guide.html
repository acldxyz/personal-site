      <p>I spent hours researching what to pack for the Big Day. For such a frequent and important event, I could not find a straightforward list. Below is 1) everything I brought into the hospital, 2) all the extra hospital stuff we took home and how we used it around the house, and 3) notes on the process of moving in and out of the hospital.</p>

      <h3>The Essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality instant coffee.</strong> Take <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/us/eng/product/craft-instant-coffee-bold" target="_blank">one jar</a> to the hospital and keep the house stocked up.</li>
        <li><strong>Toiletries.</strong> Don't forget shampoo and body wash.</li>
        <li><strong>Water bottle.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Eye mask.</strong> Hospital rooms never get dark.</li>
        <li><strong>Earplugs.</strong> I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wax-Ear-Plugs-Sleeping-Swimming/dp/B07DNFD3HM/" target="_blank">these</a>.<sup>1</sup> They blocked noise from inside the room, the hallway, and anyone we shared a wall with.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfortable clothes.</strong> I had 2 pairs of sweats (I swear by <a href="https://www.tracksmith.com/products/m-session-pants" target="_blank">these</a>), 2 t-shirts, 2 long-sleeve shirts, 1 pair of heavy socks, 1 heavy sweatshirt, and 4 pairs of underwear</li>
        <li><strong>Slippers.</strong> You'll do no better than <a href="https://www.armorlux.com/en/products/striped-slippers-size-44-to-48-wool-navire-braise-homme-59042" target="_blank">these</a>. If you can't find them stateside, <a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/124664" target="_blank">L.L.Bean</a> won't fail you.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandals.</strong> Something you can wear for hallway errands and in the shower, if you want a buffer between you and the floor.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Charging-Cable-Generation-Block/dp/B0BZVLX6JJ/" target="_blank">Long phone</a> and computer charger(s).</strong> Bring several. You'll drain your battery fast sharing the good news and staying awake.</li>
        <li><strong>iPad or laptop.</strong> Some way to stream content other than your phone. You do not want to rely on hospital room TVs.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth speaker.</strong> I forgot one &mdash; big mistake. I had to <a href="day-0-the-hospital.html">play music from my phone</a> in the operating room.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pillow + pillowcase.</strong> I didn't bring one. It's my one regret. I had 4 hospital pillows at my disposal. They were all disappointing.</li>
        <li><strong>Shower towel.</strong> I'd guess the hospital-provided one went through 200+ industrial wash cycles before I picked it up.</li>
        <li><strong>Weighted blanket.</strong> When I slept, I slept soundly. A warning, it's a pain to lug in and out. I'd go through the inconvenience again without question.</li>
        <li><strong>Snacks.</strong> Have a visitor bring these. One less thing for you to carry.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hospital Gear to Take With You</h3>
      <p>I heard from several people, &ldquo;If it's not bolted to the ground, take it.&rdquo; Good advice, but there's plenty we took and haven't touched. Below is everything we took and how we used it at home. Bring an extra bag or two to pack it all out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diapers.</strong> Take them all. Whatever size you need, start packing them away as soon as you get to your room. The nurses will keep you stocked at all times, and never did they question how many we needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Wipes.</strong> Again, take them all.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloth swaddles.</strong> These worked great in the hospital, and we must have packed away 20 on the way out. We'll use one to line the <a href="https://www.oxo.com/shop/baby-toddler/splash-and-store-bathtub.html" target="_blank">baby tub</a>, so Ronan doesn't slip around against the plastic. We'll put another down on our bed to protect our sheets when we're gooping him up after his bath. We stopped using these as swaddles when we came home and switched to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swaddle-Blankets-Breathable-Receiving-Essentials/dp/B0CL9SJ88Z/" target="_blank">muslin blankets</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ollie-Swaddle-Sky-Moisture-Wicking-overheating-Size/dp/B01831ZNWW/" target="_blank">Ollie Swaddle</a>. Those took us through the first 12 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Premixed formula bottles.</strong> Take as many of these as you can. Even if you're breastfeeding, these are incredible to have as backup. They're also great to pack in a diaper bag.</li>
        <li><strong>Knit Caps.</strong> Take a bunch of hospital caps home. For a while, these were the only hats that would stay on Ronan's head.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic Syringes.</strong> Take 4 home. They're great for dosing out Tylenol after the first set of vaccination shots at 8 weeks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to Leave Behind</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hospital bottle nipples.</strong> These worked, and I didn't realize how crappy they were until we started using our own bottles. Buy the <a href="https://www.babylist.com/gp/babylist-bottle-box-5-bottles/46227/1857293" target="_blank">bottle box</a> from Babylist. Try out a few and see what works best for you and the little one. We went all in on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comotomo-Baby-Bottle-Bundle-Green/dp/B07Q8CV9W3/" target="_blank">Comotomo</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Hospital pump parts.</strong> They won't fit whatever you use at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic buckets.</strong> Took a few; haven't touched them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other Notes</h3>
      <p><strong>Sleep.</strong> You'll be interrupted all the time. Whether it's the general persistence of hospital lights and beeping, the nurses coming in to check on the new mom and baby, or the round-the-clock caring for the little one&hellip; You'll be up all the time.</p>

      <p><strong>Nursery.</strong> If the maternity floor has a nursery, use it overnight. Even if it's for only one feed cycle, let them take the baby so you can get some uninterrupted shut-eye. Some nurses tried to talk us out of it or make us feel guilty about asking. It didn't work and Ronan was in there for a few hours every night.</p>

      <p><strong>Food.</strong> The hospital food was better than we expected. Uber Eats something if you want it. Have visitors bring snacks; one less thing you need to pack/carry.</p>

      <p><strong>Leaving.</strong> Briefly discussed <a href="days-2-4-small-absurdities.html">here</a>, but staff will tell you it's a late-morning discharge. We were ready to go at 10 am. It was 4 pm by the time we left. There's no need to rush on the final day, and no one was pushing us out the door. That said, it did take me 3 trips to the car to get everything out of the hospital room.</p>

      <p><strong>Car seat.</strong> Leave the car seat in the car until the morning of your departure. It takes up a ton of space in the room and there's nothing to do with it until you leave. When you are ready to leave, call the discharge team and then put the baby in the car seat.</p>

      <p>If there's anything you've got a question about or another set of field notes you want to see, let me know.</p>
