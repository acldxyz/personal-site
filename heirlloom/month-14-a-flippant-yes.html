    <div class="article-body">
      <p>Whether we're gone for four hours or four days, the car is packed the same. This made sense when nothing was more important than getting Ronan to sleep.</p>

      <p>He's now mobile, interested in everything, and down to one nap. Things that kept him calm and stationary months ago have lost their power. That, however, has not stopped us from packing them, because <em>what if?</em></p>

      <p>We spent a night away this past weekend. That morning, Cait and I shuttled between rooms, grabbing everything we'd need. Ronan kept pace, emptying bags left on the floor.</p>

      <p>We packed and repacked the essentials: clothes, back-up clothes, toys, flatware, and food. Everything else, the &ldquo;could need&rdquo; stuff &ndash; the front carrier, a fourth spare outfit, a snowsuit that's too warm, and toys he hasn't played with in weeks &ndash; Cait or I hold up and ask the other, &ldquo;Do we need to bring this?&rdquo; The answer is always a flippant &ldquo;yeah.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Our scheduled departure time comes and goes. We finish packing Ronan's toiletries and grab a travel-size moisturizer instead of the full bottle. We're proud to have cut back somewhere. We pile into the car. We're off.</p>

      <p>6 hours later, it's bath time. New toys. Big tub. Bubbles piled high. Ronan had the time of his life. Soon, he starts rubbing his eyes, and bath time has ended. A warm towel, a fresh diaper, and he's ready for gooping. I hold the moisturizer, and by weight alone, I know I have a problem. I give it a few good taps, flick open the top, squeeze, and it's air that hits my palm. I squeeze harder. A trace emerges and retreats.</p>

      <p>The idyllic evening was over. Ronan tore at his towel in a crocodile death roll. His eyes locked on the under-sink cabinet filled with colorful, poisonous bottles.</p>

      <p>Holding Ronan down with one arm, my back tensing, I tried to think of a solution, but couldn't move past <em>Why didn't we bring the full-size moisturizer?</em></p>

      <p>My frustration snowballed. It all pointed at Cait. <em>Why did she pack the travel-size? She should have known it was empty.</em> I pulled up Ronan's pants and remembered: 12 hours earlier, frantic, tired, neither of us really paying attention, she made a suggestion; I agreed. The whole situation morphed from one of blame to absurdity. Of anything we use on Ronan, moisturizer has the highest utility-to-volume ratio, and this is where we decided to cut back.</p>

      <p>Even this turned out to be wrong. As I told this story to Cait, she pulled out a full, sealed, spare tube of moisturizer.</p>

      <p>Next time we travel, the full-size gets a flippant yes.</p>
