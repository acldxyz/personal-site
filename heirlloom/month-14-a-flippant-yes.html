    <div class="article-body">
      <p>Whether we're gone for four hours or four days, the car is packed identically. This approach made sense when sleep was paramount for Ronan.</p>

      <p>He's now mobile, curious about everything, and transitioning to a single nap daily. Objects that once kept him settled no longer hold his attention. Yet we continue packing them regardless, because <em>what if?</em></p>

      <p>We took an overnight trip last weekend. That morning, Cait and I moved between rooms gathering necessities. Ronan stayed with us, emptying any bags we left unattended.</p>

      <p>We organized and reorganized the essentials: clothing, backup clothes, toys, utensils, and food. For everything else&mdash;the "might need" category including a front carrier, extra outfits, an oversized snowsuit, and toys unused for weeks&mdash;we'd hold items up asking, "Do we need this?" The response was consistently a casual "yeah."</p>

      <p>Our planned departure slipped away. After finishing Ronan's toiletries, we grabbed a travel-size moisturizer instead of the larger container. We felt good about this one concession. We packed the car and departed.</p>

      <p>Six hours later came bathtime. Fresh toys. A spacious tub. Abundant bubbles. Ronan loved every moment. As his eyes grew heavy, bathtime concluded. With a warm towel and fresh diaper, he was ready for moisturizer. Checking the tube by weight, I sensed trouble. I tapped it repeatedly, opened the cap, squeezed&mdash;only air. Squeezing harder yielded nothing but a faint residue.</p>

      <p>The peaceful evening dissolved. Ronan thrashed in his towel. His attention turned toward the under-sink cabinet with its bright, dangerous bottles.</p>

      <p>Holding him down with one arm, my back straining, I couldn't stop thinking: <em>Why didn't we pack the full-size?</em></p>

      <p>Frustration escalated. The blame seemed clear&mdash;Cait. <em>Why did she choose the travel version? She should've checked it first.</em> Then I paused. Hours earlier, both exhausted and distracted, she'd made a suggestion and I'd quickly agreed. The situation shifted from blame to the absurd. Of everything we use on him, moisturizer offers the best ratio of usefulness to space, yet that's what we'd compromised on.</p>

      <p>That wasn't even the real ending. As I recounted this to Cait, she revealed a complete, unopened spare tube.</p>

      <p>Next journey, we're bringing the full-size without hesitation.</p>
